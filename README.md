📝 **Instructions**
---
Your task is to create an algorithm that generates a random card every time the page loads. The card will feature a random value (e.g., Ace, 2, King) and a random suit (e.g., Spades, Hearts).

## Here’s what your project should do:
1.	Dynamically generate a random card value (2-10, J, Q, K, A) and suit (♥, ♦, ♣, ♠) on each page load.
2.	Apply the appropriate styles:
    - Red suits: Hearts (♥) and Diamonds (♦)
    - Black suits: Spades (♠) and Clubs (♣)
3.	Style the card visually using CSS.


Here is an example:

### Hints:
- Generate random numbers for:
- Card values: Use arrays and random indicies to pick values like 2-10, J, Q, K, A.
- Suits: Use arrays and random indicies to pick between Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs.
- Use HTML entities or Unicode for the suit symbols (You can copy them from here) 
    `["♥", "♦", "♠", "♣"]`
